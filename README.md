# enhanced-graywolf
With the advancement of technology, the size of data is increasing rapidly. To make intelligent decisions based on data, efficient analytical methods are needed. Data clustering is a prominent analytical method of data mining that is used efficiently in data analysis. Progress in previous methods is felt to analyze large data sets.

so,This project is done to implement Article "A Novel Clustering Method Using Enhanced Grey Wolf Optimizer and
MapReduce", which is used to improve the gray wolf algorithm to reduce data volume.
In this implementation, I tried to use all the datasets introduced in this article. Also, the method proposed in this article has been compared with two methods:
1) PSO
2) simple gray wolf

In this comparison, the iris dataset was used jointly in all three methods to be able to properly compare the efficiency of the methods.
